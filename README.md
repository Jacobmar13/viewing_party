> This is the base repo for the [viewing party project](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/viewing_party) used for Turing's Backend Module 3.

## About this Project

Viewing party is an application in which users can explore movie options and create a viewing party event for the user and friend's.
[link to heroku page](https://protected-bastion-44831.herokuapp.com/)

## Local Setup

1. Fork and Clone the repo
2. Install gem packages: `bundle install`
3. Setup the database: `rails db:create`

## API
- [The Movie DB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
- Create an account and apply for an API key
- Take that key and create a `application.yml` file in the root directory
- Name it and use figaro to encrypt your key so it cant be seen from the public and add it to `application.yml` file

## Learning Goals
- Consume JSON APIs that require authentication
- Build an application that requires basic authentication
- Organize and refactor code to be more maintainable
- Implement a self-referential relationship in ActiveRecord
- Apply RuboCopâ€™s style guide for code quality
- Utilize Continuous Integration using Travis CI
- Deploy to Heroku

## Future Goals
- Add a recommended movie to view
- Allow memnbers of the viewing party to vote on a selection of movies to watch
- Search by country of origin/primary language of films
